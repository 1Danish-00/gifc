### Guidelines
* Please follow PEP-8 style guidelines.  

  The project is simple enough so you don't have to go through it all. Just follow the guidelines for variable names, class names and function names. That should be all.
* Make a seperate branch for every pull request.
* Don't push a lot of code in a single commit.
* Make pull requests to the **development** branch. After merging I will eventually decide when to merge it with the master.
* Please be patient with my responses and reviews. I will be quite busy for the next 6 months.
